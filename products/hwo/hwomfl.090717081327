THUNDERSTORMS: SCATTERED MAINLY AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ARE
EXPECTED ACROSS INTERIOR AND EAST COAST LOCATIONS, WITH ISOLATED
MAINLY LATE MORNING TO EARLY AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE
ALONG THE IMMEDIATE GULF COAST. WESTERLY STEERING FLOW WILL ALLOW

GREATEST THREATS FROM THE STORMS WILL BE HEAVY RAINFALL AND
DANGEROUS CLOUD TO GROUND LIGHTNING STRIKES.

WATERSPOUTS: A CONVERGENCE LINE HAS FORMED OFFSHORE OF THE
ATLANTIC COAST AND EXTENDS SOUTHWEST INTO BISCAYNE BAY. THIS LINE
COULD BE THE FOCUS FOR POSSIBLE WATERSPOUT DEVELOPMENT UNTIL IT
DISSIPATES LATER THIS MORNING.

FLOODING: SLOW MOVING THUNDERSTORMS WILL DROP VERY HEAVY RAINFALL
IN A FEW LOCATIONS THIS AFTERNOON. THIS MAY LEAD TO MINOR URBAN
AND ROADWAY FLOODING AND MINOR FLOODING OF OTHER FLOOD-PRONE
AREAS.

TEMPERATURES: HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB TO 90 TO 95 DEGREES
ACROSS COASTAL LOCATIONS TODAY, AND INTO THE MID 90S ACROSS THE
INTERIOR. THIS COMBINED WITH THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE
ATMOSPHERE WILL LEAD TO HEAT INDICES AROUND 105 AT PEAK HEATING
ACROSS COASTAL/METRO AREAS AND POSSIBLY AS HIGH AS 110 ACROSS THE
INTERIOR.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY

SCATTERED MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS ARE LIKELY
EACH DAY, WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ACTIVITY EARLY NEXT WEEK.
