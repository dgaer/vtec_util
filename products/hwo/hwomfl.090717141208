THUNDERSTORMS: SCATTERED MAINLY AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ARE
EXPECTED ACROSS INTERIOR AND EAST COAST LOCATIONS, WITH ISOLATED
MAINLY LATE MORNING TO EARLY AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE
ALONG THE IMMEDIATE GULF COAST. WESTERLY STEERING FLOW WILL ALLOW

GREATEST THREATS FROM THE STORMS WILL BE DANGEROUS CLOUD TO GROUND 
LIGHTNING STRIKES, AND HEAVY RAINFALL. A FEW STRONG STORMS WITH 
GUSTY WINDS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS PALM BEACH COUNTY. 

WATERSPOUTS: LIGHT LOW LEVEL WINDS AND A MOIST ENVIRONMENT COULD 
LEAD TO A FEW WATERSPOUTS DEVELOPING OVER THE LOCAL WATERS TODAY.

WIND: ONE OR TWO STORMS COULD BECOME STRONG WITH WIND GUSTS OF
40 TO 50 MPH THIS AFTERNOON. SHOULD STRONG STORMS MANAGE TO DEVELOP, 
THE MOST LIKELY AREA OF DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE ACROSS PALM BEACH AND 
BROWARD COUNTIES.

FLOODING: SLOW MOVING THUNDERSTORMS WILL DROP VERY HEAVY RAINFALL
IN A FEW LOCATIONS THIS AFTERNOON. THIS MAY LEAD TO MINOR URBAN
AND ROADWAY FLOODING AND MINOR FLOODING OF OTHER FLOOD PRONE
AREAS.

TEMPERATURES: HIGH TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON WILL CLIMB INTO THE
MID 90S OVER THE INTERIOR AND ACROSS THE WESTERN SUBURBS OF THE PALM 
BEACH, BROWARD, AND MIAMI-DADE METROPOLITAN AREAS. THESE TEMPS, 
COMBINED WITH HIGH HUMIDITY, WILL MAKE IT FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS BETWEEN
100 AND 105 DEGREES THIS AFTERNOON.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY

SCATTERED MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE
EACH DAY, WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ACTIVITY EARLY NEXT WEEK.
