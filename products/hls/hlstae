LOCALLY HIGHER SURGES WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE BAYS AND INLETS ALONG THE
COAST. HERB WILL LIKELY BE MAKING LANDFALL NEAR LOW TIDE ALONG THE
TAYLOR AND DIXIE COUNTY COAST. ONCE AGAIN...BASED ON THE TIDAL
RANGES...THIS WILL PRODUCE AN OVERALL STORM TIDE OF 14 TO 18 FEET
BETWEEN DEKLE BEACH AND THE MOUTH OF THE SUWANNEE RIVER. LOCATIONS

FEET...WITH THE LOWER AMOUNTS NEAR THE AUCILLA RIVER ENTRANCE.
