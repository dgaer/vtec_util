# HTTP persistent connection testing using Firefox
# Last modified: 07/15/2016

When using Firefox to test load balanced HTTP connections there is a
default limit of 6 persistent connection Firxfox will allow. To
increase this limit for testing, enter the following URL: 

about:config

Search for:

network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server

Change the default from 6 to a higher number.
