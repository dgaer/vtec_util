 
The Universal Geographic Code (UGC) is a site specific identifier used
for warnings, watches, forecasts, and any other products needing
geographic coding to assist in site-specific distribution. The
"existing UGC" will be phased out by the National Weather Service and
will be replaced by a "new UGC" which will be consistent with the
ability of weather products to identify more localized areas within a
county to which the forecast/warning applies. This section describes
the characteristics of both the "existing UGC" and the "new UGC."

In the existing UGC, the format consists of 6 alphanumeric characters
followed by a purge date/time in UTC. Each code group (including
date/time) is ended by a dash (-). There are two variations to the
code: one version uses a "C" for the third character and is for
products issued on a county-by-county basis (mainly short-fused
warnings); the other uses a "Z" for the third character, and is for
products issued for unique NWS zone(s) or for part or all of a
state(s).


Explanation of UGC Code Elements

SSCNNN-DDHHMM- For Short -Fuse Warnings and follow-up Severe Local
Storm Watch Area Outlines (by county redefinition); 

or

SSZNNN-DDHHMM- For Severe Local Storm Watches, Longer-Fuse Watches and
Warnings, Public Forecast, Marine Forecasts and Warnings, etc. 

where:

SS is the Two letter state or Great Lakes I.D.

C indicates that the number NNN that follows represents a county or
independent city, or 

Z The NNN that follows represents a unique NWS zone (land or water) or
part or all of a state (or Great Lake). 

NNN (After "C"), the number of the county/city(1), or

(After "Z"), the number of the zone or part or all of a state(2)

DD is the purge Date (UTC)

HH Is the purge hour (UTC)

MM is the purge Minutes (UTC)

- is the code separator/end of address

C.12.4.2.3 Examples of Warnings in the existing UGC

(A) Examples For Individual Counties/Cities

Code County/City

(1) MEC003- Aroostook County, Maine

(2) KYC101- Henderson County, Kentucky

(3) C0C041- El Paso, Colorado

(4) VAC760- Richmond, Virginia (politically independent city)

(5) MOC510- St. Louis, Missouri (politically independent city)

(B) More Than One County In Same State

If a warning is for more than one county in the same state, the
appropriate county number(s) will be added (with each group separated
by a dash). Note that the "SSC" does not need to proceed each county
number set after the first grouping. 

Also, the county number sets do not have to be in numerical sequence.

Example:

ILC043-089-031-191650- Warning for DuPage, Kane and Cook Counties,
Illinois; expires on 19th of the month at 1650 UTC. 

(C) County(s) In More Than One State

If a warning is for counties in more than one state, the appropriate
state I.D. and county numbers will be added. 

Example

SDC127-NEC043-173-IAC193-149-040030- Warning for Union County, South
Dakota; Gakota and Thurston Counties, Nebraska; and Woodbury and
Plymouth Counties, Iowa; expires on the 4th of the month at 0030 UTC> 

Severe storm watches issued by the SPC cover large areas, frequently
containing (parts of) several states. Since so many counties would be
involved in using the "C" form, watches, instead, will use the "Z"
form of the geographic code, allowing large areas to be encompassed in
one code grouping. (Severe Local Storm Watch Area Outlines issued by
local offices after the SPC watch, list counties and use the "C"
form.) 

For implementation of the code in watches, the NNN following the "Z"
will be three zeros "000". The SSZ000 is used to designate any part or
all of a state which falls within the watch area. 

(A) Examples Of Codes For Individual States

Code State

(1) CAZ000- (All or any part of) California

(2) TXZ000- (All or any part of) Texas

(3) VAZ000- (All or any part of) Virginia

(B) Examples Of Actual Code For More Than One State

SCZ000-GAZ000-FLZ000-160200- Watch area encompasses (all or parts of)
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, and expires on the 16th of the
month at 0200 UTC (10 PM EDT on the 15th). 

Note that the code will not refer to coastal waters. The phrase "And
Adjacent Coastal Waters," however, will be found in the text of the
Watch, as appropriate. 

(C) The Great Lakes will be Coded

Code State

(1) LSZ000- (All or any part of) Lake Superior

(2) LMZ000- (All or any part of) Lake Michigan

(3) LHZ000- (All or any part of) Lake Huron

(4) LEZ000- (All or any part of) Lake Erie

(5) LOZ000- (All or any part of) Lake Ontario

Example including Great Lakes:

WIZ000-MIZ000-LSZ000-LMZ000-022315-

Watch area encompasses ( all or parts of) Wisconsin, Michigan, and
(all or parts of) Lake Superior and Lake Michigan; expires on the 2nd
of the month at 2315 UTC (615 PM CDT). 

C.12.4.2.5 Existing Universal Geographic Code Placement

The composition and total number of lines of the communication headers
of Warnings and Watches (and any other messages) will vary according
to the circuits through which they are disseminated, e.g., Family of
Services, NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS), etc. 

The placement of the UGC code will occur in either of two formats:

(1) For those products that contain only one narrative text (e.g.,
    warnings, watches, statements, and certain state [1- 5 days]
    forecasts, etc.), the UGC code will always be found immediately
    after the WMO line of the communications header (see examples). 

(2) For those products that contain two or more narrative texts under
    one AFOS/WMO identifier (e.g., zone, short term, marine,
    forecasts, and certain state forecasts), the UGC code will be
    found not after the WMO line as in (1) above, but a separate UGC
    code will be found immediately before each narrative text with a
    $$ (double dollar sign) immediately following each narrative
    text.

C.12.4.3 New Universal Geographic Code (New UGC)

C.12.4.3.1 New UGC Code Format and Elements

In the new Universal Geographic Code (UGC), the basic format consists
of 6 alphanumeric characters for the first code group, followed by a
dash (-), and then followed either by the purge date/time in UTC (in
the case where only one state and/or county applies), or, in the case
of multiple states, counties, or parts thereof, one set of 4
alphanumeric characters for each of these entities, followed by a dash
(-), and finally by the purge date/time in UTC. Thus, as described
above, in a single watch or warning, there may be multiple state IDS
and multiple county FIPS codes. 

C.12.4.3.2 Explanation of New UGC Elements

The five elements that comprise the specific new UGC are as follows:

SS is the State ID(The two alpha-character Federal designation for
each state), or in the case of marine areas, it is the Ocean or Great
Lake ID. 

P is the Part of County indicator (1 - 9; 0 indicates the entire
county). The Part of County designation will be unique for each
county. In the case of marine areas, it is the part of the marine
area. 

NNN indicates the County FIPS#, as specified in FIPS PUB 55; Codes For
Named Populated Places and Related Entities of the States of the
United States, current volume. In the case of marine areas, it is the
marine area number. 

DDHHMM is the Purge of the watch or warning date/time (hour, minute) in UTC

- is the County/Marine Area separator, and End of Code symbol

C.12.4.3.3 New UGC Format - Geographic Examples

Geographic examples of the new UGC format are:

(a) Single State & County: ssPnnn-DDHHMM-

(b) Single State, Multiple County: ssPnnn-Pnnn-Pnnn-DDHHMM-

(c) Multiple State & Multiple County: ssPnnn-Pnnn-ssPnnn-Pnnn-DDHHMM-
 

C.12.4.3.4 New UGC Format - Specific Examples

Specific examples of the new UGC format are:

(a) KS7167-120730-

Part 7 of Russell County, Kansas, expires on the 12th day at 7:30 UTC.

(b) MD0031-6033-222200-

In the state of Maryland, all of Montgomery county, and part 6 of Prince Georges county, expires on the 22nd day, at 22:00 UTC.

(c) IL5093-7169-IN8045-0055-050530-

In the state of Illinois, part 5 of Kendall county and part 7 of
Schuyler county; in the state of Indiana, part 8 of Fountain county
and all of Greene county; expires on the 5th day, at 5:30 UTC. 
 
C.12.4.3.5 New UGC Placement

The structure of the communication message for Warnings and Watches
will be the same and will dictate the placement of the UGC code
line(s). The nominal structure is as follows with the UGC in bold:

C.12.4.4 Existing/New UGC Comparison

1. The county (or politically independent city not in a county) is
   represented by a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
   number, issued by the Census Bureau. Each county/independent city
   within a state has a unique FIPS number (001, 003, etc.) although
   the numbers are repeated from state to state. 

2. For the UGC code in Severe Local Storm Watches, the NNN will be set
   to 000. For combined Severe Local Storm and Special Marine
   Warnings, both the SSCNNN- and the SSZNNN- groups of the UGC will
   be used.
